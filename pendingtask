Create Login and Signup Pages: Implement a login and signup feature for user authentication. These pages should allow users to register and log in using their credentials.

Implement Redux for User Authentication: Set up Redux to manage user authentication states, such as whether a user is logged in or not.

Build Protected Routes for Authentication: Implement protected routes so that only logged-in users can access specific pages, such as employee management or personal information.

Style the Forms and Buttons in Tailwind: Ensure all form elements and buttons, such as those for login, signup, and adding employee data, are styled effectively using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive layout.

Handle Form Validation: Add form validation for login, signup, and employee forms to check for required fields, correct email formats, and valid input values before submission.

Handle Errors for Forms: Implement error handling to display messages when the user submits invalid data in any form (e.g., missing fields or incorrect formats).

Add Edit and Delete Functionality for Employee Data: Enable the ability to edit or delete employee records. Provide appropriate UI elements (buttons) and connect them with Redux actions to manage changes.

Display Employee List Dynamically: Ensure employee data is displayed dynamically in a table format with proper handling of all employee details like name, email, and phone number.

Connect the Forms with the Redux Store: Link the employee form with the Redux store so that new employee data is properly stored and accessible for the list view.

Add Navigation Between Pages: Implement navigation between different pages, such as the employee list, the add employee form, and the login/signup pages, using React Router.

Implement Logout Functionality: Add a feature that allows the user to log out, which will update the authentication state and redirect the user to the login page.
